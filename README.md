## Project: **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 
***
In this project, I used the following techniques from previous lessons:

- Color selection
- Region of interest selection
- Canny edge detection 
- Hough Transform for lane line detection

There are flags that turns some features on and off, like color selection, and averaging the lines.
